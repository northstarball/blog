Hey everyone! This is my first blog post!

You're probably thinking, "this doesn't sound that interesting. Why don't you just use Facebook or something like everybody else?"

Well, the answer is about 33% "I don't know", another 33% "I love programming", and another 34% "no one makes blogs anymore".

There are plenty of other platforms that I could have chosen, like [Ghost](https://www.google.com/search?q=ghost+blog&oq=ghost+blog&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1223j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), [Medium](https://medium.com/), or [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com). But those are easy, and it feels like cheating.

Anyway, this site is more for me to practice writing, regurgitate information, and post things for your eyes to watch.

Like this!

What's next? I'll probably make a favicon to make this feel a little more like home.

See you around!
